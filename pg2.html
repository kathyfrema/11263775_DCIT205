        <p class="content">
        Computer science is the foundation of the information technology era that we currently reside in. Therefore, if society is to achieve quick economic progress and fully benefit from information technology, computer science education is essential. <br>The study and creation of programs that enable us to use computers on a daily basis, the software systems that underpin these applications, and the techniques and procedures employed to create applications and systems that function consistently, precisely, and morally are all included in computer science. The ability to program computers is at the core of computer science, and companies employing computer scientists look for competent programmers who recognize the most current techniques and tools and can apply solid engineering principles to the development of design and upkeep of computer applications.
       <br> Our graduates are prepared for the computing industry by the wide range of courses offered in the department and the skills they acquire. These courses enable students to work in a project team, research and development team, or another environment where they can contribute specific expertise. Furthermore, by introducing students to current computer science research topics and both existing and new technologies and approaches, the course provides a platform to conduct further study or research.<br>
        The Department of Computer Science offers two undergraduate degree programs: <br>The Bachelor of Science in Information Technology and the Bachelor of Science in Computer Science Single-Major and Major-Minor.
