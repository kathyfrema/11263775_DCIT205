      <h1 class="heading">Course Description</h1>
      <h2 class="heading">CSCD 721 Grand Research Challenges in Computer Science</h2>
       <p class="mphil-para">
        Wireless communication has become a ubiquitous part of modern life, from global cellular telephone systems to local and even personal-area networks. This course provides an in-depth introduction to digital mobile wireless networks, illustrating theoretical underpinnings with a wide range of real-world examples. The course will review propagation phenomena, modulation techniques, multiple access schemes, and coding techniques, air interface design, wireless network planning and operations, GSM, TDMA and CDMA technologies.
       </p>

        <h2 class="heading">CSCD 725	Research in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</h2>
      <p class="mphil-para">  The aim of this course unit is to survey the research landscape of advanced DBMS systems with a view to understanding how DBMS research is responding to challenges arising from new software architectures, new kinds of data resource and new computational fabrics. Topics include: Architecture, Components: The Classical Case and Variations; The Relational Case: Data Models, Databases, Languages; Query Processing (1): Overview, Equivalence-Based Rewriting; Query Processing (2): Algorithms, Evaluation Strategies, Cost-Based Optimization; Parallel DBMSs [2]; Distributed DBMSs and Dataspaces; Massively-Parallel/Massively-Distributed Data Processing; NoSQL and Cloud Database; Stream Data Management; Sensor Network Data Management

        <h2 class="heading">FASC 702	Advanced Quantitative Research Methods</h2>
        <p class="mphil-para">The course will serve as a step up for students who need to add up to their knowledge in quantitative methods of research techniques and analyses.<br>Topics to be covered include: Sampling distributions and hypothesis testing.Sample size determination. Categorical data and chi-square, Non parametric tests.Principles of Design of Experiments.Analysis of variance and its assumptions. Experiments with single and multiple factors. Orthogonal and multiple Comparisons. Completely Randomized, Randomized Complete Block, repeated measures, cross over and Latin square designs. Nested designs. Fixed, random and mixed effects models. Factorial designs. Confounding. Fractional factorial designs. Split plot designs. Incomplete block designs. Analysis of covariance. Regression models: basic concepts; Regression Model Diagnostics. Categorical data analysis. Logistic regression, univariate and multivariate. Confounding and collinearity in logistic regression.Model selection in logistic regression

        <h2 class="heading">CSCD 710	Seminar I (Research Proposal)</h2>
        <p class="mphil-para">This course will focus on developing the original synopsis or other agreed topic into a full PhD proposal. The ultimate aim of this seminar is to enable students to obtain feedback from the supervisory team on what directions to take to successfully complete a quality dissertation. The full proposal should <br>(1) define a problem of interest to the student<br> (2) summarize past work<br> (3) outline work on an approach to solving the problem and (4) present initial results obtained. Ideally the subject matter of this proposal should be publishable in conference proceedings ranked at C or above in the ERA list.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">CSCD 720	Seminar II (Experiential research learning)</h2>
        <p class="mphil-para">This seminar will provide candidates with the opportunity to demonstrate knowledge they have gained through experience. <br>Opportunities will be provided, as far is possible, to enable candidates gained industrially or commercially relevant experience and to demonstrate that through their work.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading">CSCD 740	Seminar IV (Research Results)</h2>
        <p class="mphil-para">This is the final part of the work, a public presentation of the major findings of the research. The presentation will be subject to scrutiny by an external examiner, an internal examiner, the supervisory team and the general public. The aim is to ensure that the work is of an acceptably high standard deserving of an award of the degree of doctor of philosophy.
